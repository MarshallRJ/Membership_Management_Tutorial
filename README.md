**Membership Management Tutorial**
 
This is an introductory tutorial into Shesha that will expose you to all the key Shesha concepts you will need to allow you to quickly start building your own **Shesha-based applications**.

For the tutorial we will take you through the process of building a '**Membership Management**' application. The Membership Management could typically be used by a Club to track its members, payment of membership fees and processing of applications. We take you through the process of building the application, step-by-step, whilst exposing you to the key concepts. 

Once completed you will be ready to build your very own Shesha application. For more advanced topics and information please consult the reference documentation on the Shesha web-site. 

## Prerequisites
In order to complete the tutorial successfully, you should have some understanding of [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) Core and [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) and the following tools installed:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Frontend
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - Backend
- [SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16) - Database

**NOTE**:  In order to be able to run your frontend, version **12.22.3** of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v12.22.3/) should be installed. If you already have another version of node installed, you can use ‘Node Version Manager’ to toggle between the versions, so as to not hinder other projects which depend on other versions of Node. More information on node version management can be found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/nvm-for-windows-how-to-download-and-install-node-version-manager-in-windows-10/#:~:text=To%20install%20the%20LTS%20version,%2C%20nvm%20install%2014.20.0%20).
